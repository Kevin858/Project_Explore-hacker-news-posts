# Exploring Hacker News Posts

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

1) Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2) Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?


## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receive the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between 12:00 - 13:00 PST.

However, it should be noted that the data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 12:00 - 13:00 PST received the most comments on average.
